## About Me

I am a **Ph.D. candidate** in the AI Thrust at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Guangzhou campus. I am fortunate to be advised by [Xuming Hu @ HKUST](https://xuminghu.github.io/) and [Raymond Chi-Wing Wong @ HKUST](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~raywong/). 

I also serve as a **Resident Doctoral Researcher** at [INSAIT](https://insait.ai/), under the supervision of [Prof. Luc Van Gool](https://insait.ai/prof-luc-van-gool/) and [Dr. Danda Paudel](https://insait.ai/dr-danda-paudel/). Recently, I have also been collaborating with [Linfeng Zhang @ SJTU](http://www.zhanglinfeng.tech/) and [Kailun Yang @ HNU](https://www.yangkailun.com/).

My research centers on **machine perception**, **reasoning**, and **interaction** with the physical world.

Currently, I focus on:

- **Multi-modal Learning**: foundation models, representation learning, self-supervision, contrastive alignment.
- **Multi-modal Large Models**: spatial & embodied reasoning, debiasing, retrieval-augmented understanding & generation.
- **Multi-modal in Computer Vision**: novel sensors, sensor fusion, scene understanding.
