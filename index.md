## About Me
I am a second year Ph.D. student in AI Thrust at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Guangzhou campus. I am delighted in working with [Xuming Hu @ HKUST](https://xuminghu.github.io/). 

Recently, I also collaborate with [Athanasios Vasilakos @ UiA](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=_yWPQWoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), [Peng Yuan Zhou @ AU](https://www.au.dk/en/pengyuan.zhou@ece.au.dk), [Linfeng Zhang @ SJTU](http://www.zhanglinfeng.tech/), [Kailun Yang @ HNU](https://www.yangkailun.com/) and [Yin Zhou @ Waymo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yin-zhou-91a7b827/). 

Previously, I worked closely with [Addison Lin Wang @ NTU](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=SReb2csAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and earned my B.Eng and M.Eng degrees at Northeastern University under the supervision of [Chong Fu @ NEU](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=xq76xEMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

I study machine perception, reasoning, and interaction with the physical world, drawing inspiration from **human cognition**. Lately, I’ve been focusing on unfied multi-modal Learning and advanced sensing & perception techniques.
